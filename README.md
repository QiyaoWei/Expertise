To start, the full TCGA and News dataset can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/QiyaoWei/Defining-Expertise/tree/main)

You should put them in the folders `dataset/tcga` or `dataset/news`, and then `bash run.sh` should give you all the raw predictive numbers, after which running b.ipynb+d.ipynb should give you all the results.
