The folder appendix_data contains all the experiments in the paper. Each of the folders indicate the experiment setting (linear) and
the experiment dataset (tcga/news), under which there are results for the predictive case and the prognostic case.

For ease of replication, please kindly ask me to give you the tcga and news data.

bash run.sh in the pred folder should give you all the raw predictive numbers, after which running final.ipynb and outputting all plots data should give you all the predictive results.

bash run.sh in the prog folder should give you all the raw prognostic numbers, after which running final.ipynb and outputting all plots data should give you all the prognostic results.
